TODO

- mime-decode Subject:-Header and then check the length
- Check age of the Date:-Header (emails from 1970 or from the distant future should be rejected)
- If there are multiple addresses in the From:-Header, then there MUST be a Sender:-Header
- If an Exception is thrown while parsing a header, should we REJECT the email instead of ACCEPTing it?
